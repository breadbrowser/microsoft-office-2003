To avoid having your rules become incompatible, follow these steps:</p><ul><li>Uninstall Outlook 2003, and then install Microsoft Outlook 2002 Service Pack 2 or later.</li><li>Install Microsoft Outlook 2002 Service Pack 2 or later on any computer you use to access the same account.
</li></ul><p>Return to <a href="#Contents">Contents</a></p><p><h3><a id="AddIns" name="AddIns">Add-ins that previously worked with Outlook may now cause you to be prompted to allow access to Outlook data</a></h3></p><p>Outlook has increased security around the Outlook Object Model, which many third-party software companies use to integrate their product with Outlook. These new security enhancements may now cause you to be prompted to allow the programs access to your Outlook data.</p><p>In some cases, the third-party software companies may provide updated versions of their software that will not cause you to be prompted for access to your Outlook data. For technical information regarding this change, see the <a href="#OMSection">Outlook Object Model</a> section later in this file and the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) Web article titled  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dno2k3ta/html/odc_olsecnotescomaddins.asp">Important Security Notes for Microsoft Outlook COM Add-In Developers</a>.</p><p>Return to <a href="#Contents">Contents</a></p><p><h3><a id="PS419541" name="PS419541">ActiveX controls will not load in one-off forms</a></h3></p><p>When Outlook receives a message containing a form definition, the item is considered to be a one-off form. To help prevent unwanted script and controls from running in one-off forms, Outlook will not load ActiveX controls in one-off forms by default. This behavior can be controlled by administrators using one of the following registry settings:</p><p>HKCU\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Outlook\Security</p><p>HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Outlook\Security</p><p>AllowActiveXOneOffForms (DWORD)</p><p>not present - Only load controls that are listed below. (default)
<br>0 - Only load controls that are listed below.
<br>1 - Allow only safe controls.
<br>2 - Allow all ActiveX controls.
</p><p>The following controls can be used in one-off forms:</p><ul><li>Controls from fm20.dll</li><li>Microsoft Office Outlook Rich Format Control</li><li>Microsoft Office Outlook Recipient Control</li><li>Microsoft Office Outlook View Control</li></ul><p>Return to <a href="#Contents">Contents</a></p><p><h3><a id="PS444960" name="PS444960">Using Outlook 2003 and then using any Collaboration Data Objects Library (CDO) 1.2x application may cause Microsoft Exchange Server to stop working</a></h3></p><p>If you use Outlook 2003 and then use any Collaboration Data Objects Library (CDO) 1.2x application, such as Microsoft Outlook Web Access for Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5, Exchange Server may stop working if you have not previously installed the hotfix mentioned in the applicable Knowledge Base (KB) article below. 
</p><p><b>Note</b>  Versions of Outlook Web Access for Exchange Server later than Exchange Server 5.5 are not affected because the later versions do not use CDO. However, other CDO-enabled applications are affected unless the hotfix has been installed for the version of Exchange Server that you are using.
